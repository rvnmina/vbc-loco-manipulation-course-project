## Code Implementation

The code used in this project is based on an open-source implementation and my
partial modifications carried out for the course assignment.

- Original repository:
  https://github.com/Ericonaldo/visual_wholebody

- My fork with course-specific changes (partial implementation):
  https://github.com/rvnmina/visual_wholebody

### Notes
- The modified implementation is approximately "70% complete"
- The focus of this project was experimentation, understanding, and simulation
  results rather than delivering a fully production-ready system
